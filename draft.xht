	<p>During this summer and my last semester at UMass I read a few good books:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Tall Trees and Wild Bees</dt><dd><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7615752">Stewart Coffin</a> writes about growing up in Amherst.</dd>
		<dt>The Last Man on the Moon</dt><dd>Astronaut Eugene Cernan's biography that he wrote with coauthor Don Davis.</dd>
		<dt>Wise Blood</dt><dd>My suggestion for the Page to Screen book club, a novel by Flannery O'Connor.</dd>
		<dt>As I Lay Dying</dt><dd>1930 novel by William Faulkner, set in Mississippi.</dd>
		<dt><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/leo-tolstoy/hadji-murad/aylmer-maude">Hadji Murád</a></dt><dd>Leo Tolstoy's story as translated by Aylmer Maude.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Also during the semester I wrote an SVG to stylize the initials of the recreational math club. It's supposed to look similar to Escher's <cite>Circle Limit</cite> series, and is based on the surface of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucube">mucube</a> with a repeating pattern. The thinly outlined quadrilaterals are distorted square faces.</p>

		<h3>Granjon Boxes</h3>
		<p>This month I started working on font which will recreate some of the typographical ornaments created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Granjon">Robert Granjon</a>. A few years ago, in an essay by <a href="https://elliotoffner.com/bio.html">Elliot Offner</a>, I was introduced to the following set of six pieces of moveable type which can serve as the building blocks for complex printed arabesques.</p>

		<p>Offner published a book <cite>The Granjon Arabesque</cite></p>

		<p>The arrangement of Unicode box-drawing characters above is my recreation of a design featured on page 105 of <cite>Granjon's flowers</cite> by Hendrik D. L. Vervliet. The characters were traced in Inkscape, creating <a href="https://home.6t.lt/689/granjon-boxes.svg">an SVG</a> file, which was converted <a href="https://home.6t.lt/fonts/granjon-boxes.woff2">to WOFF2</a> using FontForge. So far, the <cite>Granjon Boxes</cite> font contains the characters <q><code>┑┘┖┏╺╸╷╻╴╶╹╵┝┫┬┰┨├┻┷</code></q> and the space character U+20.</p>
		<p>If you're reading this on my website, you should be able to click or press down on the arrangements and reveal the typical box-drawing character designs by displaying them in the <cite><a href="https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/ksquare/">Kreative Square</a></cite> font.</p>

		<p>The much more comprehensive font <cite><a href="https://www.juanjez.com/designing-a-revival-graveur/">Graveur</a></cite> by Juanjo López is based on the work of Robert Granjon and also includes some of these decorative characters.</p>
