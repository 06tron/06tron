website, if the repo is downloaded and moved to some local folder, the files should still work. Should links ever be relative?

time folders (ex: 66c)
	/index.html -> overview of folder contents, links and maybe iframes. View at "https://home.6t.lt/66c"
	/entry.xhtml.m4 -> html fragment to be inserted into an atom feed. This will probably not be valid XML
	named html (ex: /note.html) -> fully standalone, can be downloaded individually
	/script.js -> most javascript in the folder should be in this file
	other files (ex: mirror_polygon.svg) -> work which is somewhat separate from entry.xhtml.m4

atom.xml -> Read "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5005", should there be more than one feed file?

draft.html -> pass time like "66c" as query parameter, and display 66c/entry.xhtml.m4

icons -> folder for icons for all my webpages


DOMAIN MAPPING

numberspace ->				6vt.nl
