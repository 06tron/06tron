![Small Sudoku Puzzle](thumbs/hallway_portals.png)

A Sudoku variant that doesn't change anything but the shape of the puzzle.
This [interactive website](https://06tron.github.io/numberspace/) is a work in progress.
So far there are two easy puzzles a visitor can play, as long as they have a keyboard and mouse.

These oddly shaped puzzles are built upon a graph structure.
There is a vertex for each cell in the puzzle.
For example a regular Sudoku puzzle would have 81 vertices.
The player traverses this graph by moving their mouse between adjacent cells.

There are two components to the player's position on the board.
The first is the current vertex, which represents one of the puzzle's cells.
The second is this cell's placement on the screen, which I call its level.
The level describes the cell's horizontal position, vertical position, and orientation.
There are eight possible orientations in this game, which correspond to the symmetries of a square.

I put this collage together in November 2021, using material related to books published by the University of Massachusetts Press.
